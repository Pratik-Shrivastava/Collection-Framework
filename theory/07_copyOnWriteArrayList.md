# 📝 CopyOnWriteArrayList

## 🌟 Introduction
CopyOnWriteArrayList is a **thread-safe** variant of ArrayList in Java. It is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and is designed for **concurrent read-heavy** operations.

### 🔍 How It Works:
- ✍️ **Copy on Write**: Whenever a write operation (like adding or removing an element) occurs, a **new copy** of the list is created instead of modifying the existing list.

- 🔄 **Thread Safety**: Ensures that other threads reading the list while it's being modified are **unaffected**, avoiding `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### ⚡ Performance Considerations:
- ✅ **Read Operations**: Fast and direct, since they happen on a **stable list** without interference from modifications.

- ❌ **Write Operations**: A **new copy** of the list is created for every modification, making write operations **expensive** in terms of memory and performance.
- 🎯 **Best Use Case**: When **read operations** are significantly more frequent than write operations.

## ❌ Issue with Modifying an `ArrayList` While Iterating
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ArrayListIssue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> shoppingList = new ArrayList<>();
        shoppingList.add("🥚 Eggs");
        shoppingList.add("🍞 Bread");

        System.out.println("🛒 Shopping List: " + shoppingList);

        for (String item : shoppingList) {
            System.out.println("📌 " + item);
            // ❌ Trying to modify the list while reading
            shoppingList.add("🧈 Butter");
        }

        System.out.println("🔄 Updated Shopping List: " + shoppingList);
    }
}
```
### ⚠️ Output:
This code will throw a **`ConcurrentModificationException`** because Java requires a **stable snapshot** of the list during iteration.

## ✅ Solution: Using `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CopyOnWriteArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> shoppingList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
        shoppingList.add("🥚 Eggs");
        shoppingList.add("🍞 Bread");

        System.out.println("🛒 Shopping List: " + shoppingList);

        for (String item : shoppingList) {
            System.out.println("📌 " + item);
            // ✅ Modifying the list while iterating
            shoppingList.add("🧈 Butter");
        }

        System.out.println("🔄 Updated Shopping List: " + shoppingList);
    }
}
```
### ✅ Output:
- 🚫 No `ConcurrentModificationException`
- 🏆 "🧈 Butter" is successfully added while iterating

## 🎯 Summary
✅ **CopyOnWriteArrayList** allows modifications while iterating without exceptions.  

✅ **Best suited** for scenarios where **read operations** dominate writes.  

⚠️ **Expensive write operations**, making it less memory-efficient for frequent modifications.  

✅ **Thread-safe**, but alternatives like `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` may be better for frequent modifications.

🚀 **Use wisely based on your application's needs!**
