# ðŸ“œ List Interface in Java

The **List** interface in Java is a part of the `java.util` package and is a sub-interface of the `Collection` interface. 
It provides a way to store an **ordered collection** of elements (known as a sequence).

Lists allow for precise control over where elements are inserted and can contain **duplicate elements**. 
The `List` interface is implemented by several classes in the **Java Collection Framework**, such as `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`, and `Stack`.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features of the List Interface

âœ… **Order Preservation** â€“ Maintains the order in which elements are inserted.

âœ… **Index-Based Access** â€“ Elements can be accessed using an index, similar to arrays.

âœ… **Allows Duplicates** â€“ Unlike `Set`, `List` permits duplicate elements.
